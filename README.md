# Introvocial
## A small project aimed to create a chat envorinment with polls to help guide the conversation.

The code is set for scaleability. With only a few minor tweaks to make it fully scaleable with 0 need to change the code when adding more polls. (Check chatLobby.js for the minor fix).

packages used:
- express
- ejs (didn't fully utilize it, but kept it in)
- socket.io
- firebase-admin
- body-parser

shout out to google for an easy javasript graph library.

To run it locally use node app.js and proceed to localhost://3000.
